    <h2>Operations</h2>
      <p>New Balance maintains a manufacturing presence in the United States, as well as in the United Kingdom for the European market, where they produce some of their most popular models such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Balance_99X_Series" target="_blank">990 model</a>â€”in contrast to its competitors, which often manufacture exclusively outside the United States and Europe.[36][37] As a result, New Balance shoes tend to be more expensive than those of many other manufacturers. To offset this pricing difference, New Balance claims to differentiate their products with technical features, such as blended gel inserts, heel counters and a greater selection of sizes, particularly for very narrow or very wide widths.[38] Between 1992 and 2019, the company made approximately $69 billion in profit.[38] In 2017, New Balance's facility in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flimby" target="_blank>">Flimby</a>, England was producing 28.000 pairs of shoes a week.[39]</p>
